   an interactive mind mapping tool
```

## What is this cool thing?

An interactive mind map! We are using Node.js, Express, Javascript, JQuery, Pug and HTML5 Canvas to make a board that you can add ideas to, then link your ideas to other ideas. Possibly with a snazzy interface.

## How do I get in on this?

Not deployed to web yet- watch this space!

Wellbeing comes first
We are not afraid of new technologies
