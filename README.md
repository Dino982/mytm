# TEAM MAP YOUR TECH MIND CHARTER
```
We have stand ups at 10:00am
We check in at 2:30pm
We reassess our MVP everyday
We commit in the present tense
We commit little and often
We thoroughly review code before merging
We value frontend development
But the backend should probably work too
Wellbeing comes first
We are not afraid of new technologies
```

# TEAM OBJECTIVES
```
- Learn Canvas
- Improve front end testing abilities
- Improve understanding of Javascript
- Use multiple technologies on a single project
```
